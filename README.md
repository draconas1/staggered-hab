Staggered Habitats Mod for Stellaris

This mod allows habitats to be built much earlier in game, but much smaller.  Instead of building a massive habitat in one go, habitats will start small, and you expand them over time as your civilisation grows.

It is heavily inspired by Habit Revamp mod by nodrogj that can be found on the steam workshop here: https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1144318391

As per the Paradox mod terms at https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/rules-for-user-made-mods-and-edits-of-pds-games.708039/ this Mod has no license of any kind.
